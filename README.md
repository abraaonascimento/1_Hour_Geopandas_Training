## Why Geopandas?
Geopandas is one of the most powerful ways to work with geospatial data currently. Also, it is an open-source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. It combines the capabilities of two powerful python libraries: pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely.
